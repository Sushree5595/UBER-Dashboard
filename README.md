This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using Uber trip data. The goal is to analyze ride patterns, cancellations, and booking behaviors to uncover actionable insights.

The project covers the full data analysis workflow:

Data Cleaning & Transformation → Performed in Power Query (handling nulls, formatting dates, standardizing columns).

Data Modeling & Calculations → Created DAX measures for metrics like total bookings, cancellations, and successful rides.

Visualization & Insights → Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI with filters and drill-down features for detailed analysis.
